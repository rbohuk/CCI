# Free Healthcare [Data] for All

```
You were hired to perform a penetration test on a website for a local healthcare facility (https://metaproblems.com/3c19e5da7edea00116b7a4c281f63d65/picoclinic). Can you get in?

A portal for a health insurance company was recently breached, and you managed to obtain the leaked creadentials (https://metaproblems.com/3c19e5da7edea00116b7a4c281f63d65/bigcorp_leak.txt). It's likely that some of you client's employees interacted with that company in the past. Perhaps it could be useful here.
